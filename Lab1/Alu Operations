;Class:CSE 313 Machine Organization Lab
;Term:Fall 2016
;Name(s): Steven Tang and
;Lab#1: ALU Operations
;Description: In this lab, we did some basic functions such as adding, subtracting, and, not, and or. 
;We first loaded a register to x3100, then copied the address to X/Y Registers. Then we did all of our operations after that. 
;In order to do the OR functions, we needed to do NOT(NOT X AND NOT Y). The reason why we needed to do it this way is because
;LC3 does not have the OR option. LC3 only has and, not, and add. At the end, we're going to get different outcomes
;because we're trying out 3 pairs for x and y. The pairs that we're testing are (10,20), (-11,15),(11,-15), and (9,12).
