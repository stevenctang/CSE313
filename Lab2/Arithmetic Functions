;Class:CSE 313 Machine Organization Lab
;Term:Fall 2016
;Name(s): Steven Tang and Andrew Hedy
;Group 9
;Lab #2: Arithmetic Functions
;Description: In this lab we're taking the values of X(x3120) and Y(x3121) into registers 1 and 0.
;After extracting the values from the memory locations, we're going to subtract them and store it in memory location x3122.
;To subtract, we first took the 1s compliment of Y, added 1 to that, and then added the outcome to X. So if it was 5 - 2, it's now 5 + (-2).
;Next we're going to take the |X| and store it in x3123 and the |Y| and store that into x3124. After we're going to compare
;which is bigger. If X is bigger we place a 1 in x3125, if Y is bigger we place a 2, and if they're equal we place a 0.
