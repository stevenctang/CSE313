;Lab#3: Days of the week
;Description: In this lab, we're going to read a users input and output a response depending on what the user entered.
;The user will input a number from 0-6 that will correspond to different days of the week. If the user enters 0, the 
;program will output the string "Sunday". If the user inputs 1, the program will output the string "Monday" and so on.
;If the user were to input anything other than 0-6, the program will print nothing.
